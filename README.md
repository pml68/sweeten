## `sweeten` your daily `iced` brew

[![Made with iced](https://iced.rs/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced)

</div>

## Overview

`sweeten` provides sweetened versions of common `iced` widgets with additional
functionality for more complex use cases. It aims to maintain the simplicity and
elegance of `iced` while offering "sweetened" variants with extended
capabilities.

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
sweeten = "0.1.0"
```

## Current Features

### `MouseArea`

A sweetened version of `iced`'s `mouse_area` widget with an additional
`on_press_with` method for capturing the click position with a closure. Use it
like:

```rust
mouse_area("Click me and I'll tell you where!",)
    .on_press_with(|point| Message::ClickWithPoint(point)),
```

### `PickList`

A sweetened version of `iced`'s `PickList` which accepts an optional closure to
disable some items. Use it like:

```rust
pick_list(
    &Language::ALL[..],
    Some(|languages: &[Language]| {
        languages
            .iter()
            .map(|lang| matches!(lang, Language::Javascript))
            .collect()
    }),
    self.selected_language,
    Message::Pick,
)
.placeholder("Choose a language...");
```

> Note that the compiler is not currently able to infer the type of the closure,
> so you may need to specify it explicitly as shown above.

### `TextInput`

A sweetened version of `iced`'s `text_input` widget with additional focus-related features:

- `.on_focus` and `.on_blur` methods for handling focus events
- Sweetened `focus_next` and `focus_previous` focus management functions, which return the ID of the focused element (these work on any focusable element)

### `Button`

A sweetened version of `iced`'s `button` widget - made focusable.

Additional changes include:
- `.on_focus` and `.on_blur` methods for handling focus events
- `background` and `subtle` styling methods backported from `0.14`

## Examples

For complete examples, see [`examples/`](examples/) or run an example like this:

```bash
cargo run --example mouse_area
```

Other examples include:
```bash
cargo run --example pick_list
cargo run --example text_input
cargo run --example button
```

## Code Structure

  - `pick_list.rs`: Sweetened pick list with item disabling
  - `text_input.rs`: Sweetened text input with focus handling
  - `button.rs`: Sweetened focusable button
  - `operation.rs`: Widget independent extra `Operation`s & `Task`s
  - (more widgets coming soon!)
